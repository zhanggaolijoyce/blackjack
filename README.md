I finish this simple game project under Scrimba(https://scrimba.com/playlist/p3py7U7)

The sum of all the cards is the player's credit. If the credit is less than 21, the player can choose to get a new card by clicking the button. If the credit is exactly equal to 21, the player gets the Blackjack and wins. However if the credit is more the 21, the player will be out of the game. The range of each card is between 0 and 12(included). When the player clicks the "START GAME" button, he or she will get two cards randomly, and all the subsequent card-drawing steps also result in a random number.

I practiced my javascript and html skills through this project, especially in the design and function implementation of buttons. Also, I learned to change the status base on different conditions. This is the first time I learned to interact with users through js.
